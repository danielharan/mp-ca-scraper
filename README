This project does two things:

-scrape Mp information
-offer a REST interface for people to download the list of MPs (XML or CSV), or get individual MP details (XML)

Bulk data is available at the following URIs:
http://lokobo.com:3000/mps
http://lokobo.com:3000/mps.xml
http://lokobo.com:3000/mps.csv

Individual MP data can be retrieved by electoral district ID (EDID), as such:
http://lokobo.com:3000/mps/59012
http://lokobo.com:3000/mps/59012.xml

All this information is in the public domain. It is provided as a public service.

*** Technical Information

The software uses ruby, rails and hpricot. See the RAILS-README for more information. You'll want to set up the database to run this. 'rake db:migrate' will create the appropriate table.

Scraping code can be found in app/models/mp.rb

To get data in your own database, I recommend using script/console. Issue the following command:

Mp.get_list
(Mp.find :all).each do |mp|
  mp.scrape
  sleep 15
end
